## Summary
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Library means collection of codes
- React released and used in instagram and facebook at first in 2011 named fax js
- In 2013 the fax js name changed and with new name called "React" and release as open source
- react.development.js is used to generate HTML and react-dom.development.js is used to generate DOM
- For brouser we need to use react-dom and for mobile we need to use react-native instead of the dom. That's why the both package is different.
- 90% of the work will be done by the react package
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a markup syntax which is look like 90% same as html given by react. Using this markup syntax we can create react element as like almost writing html inside javascript code.
- JavaScript doesn't uderstand JSX code, we will need to use transpiler (babel) which will read the JSX code and transpile to vanilla JS code
- `<script type="text/babel"` means the babel will read and transpile the JSX code and finally return the JS code.
- State is the most important thing in react
- React library tells that if you work for me to manage / chagne the states in my way, you don't need to work for DOM, I'll work with the DOM for you.
- Interpolation `*New keyword`
- We can think a react component like as a separate application. Since we can create the components in separately, so in a big team seperate developer can work in separate component and with combining all components a large app can be built. This is the beauty of react.
- We should not use jQuery inside react, if we are doing this this is a big mistake
