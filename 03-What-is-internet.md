# What is internet and how does it work

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows users to access and share information, communicate with each other, and perform a wide range of other tasks.

### Here is a brief overview of how the internet works: ###

- Data is broken down into packets: When you send or receive information over the internet, it is first broken down into small packets of data. Each packet contains a portion of the original data as well as routing information that tells it where to go.

- The packets are sent over the network: Each packet is then sent over the network, typically using a wired or wireless connection, to its destination. The packets may travel through multiple networks and devices before reaching their destination.

- Packets are reassembled: Once the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled into their original form and delivered to the intended recipient.

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) : The packets are sent over the internet using two main protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP is responsible for breaking the data down into packets and reassembling it at the destination, while IP is responsible for routing the packets to the correct destination.

- DNS: To access a website or a specific page, you need to know the IP address of the server where it is hosted. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a service that translates domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 216.58.192.174), so that the browser can find the correct server.

- HTTP: Once the browser has the IP address of the server, it can request the specific webpage using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The server responds by sending the requested webpage to the browser, which then renders it on the user's device.

When you're browsing the internet, you're likely interacting with hypertext all the time. For example, when you see a word or phrase underlined and in blue color, that's a hyperlink, when you click on it, it will take you to another webpage.

In simple terms, Hypertext is the way text can contain links to other text which allows users to navigate and access to related information easily.
