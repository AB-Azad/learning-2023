# Continuous integration
- Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository. The goal of CI is to reduce the risk of integration problems and to ensure that code changes are tested and validated automatically as soon as they are made.
- In a CI workflow, developers typically commit their code changes to a version control system like Git. A CI server then automatically builds and tests the code, and reports any errors or issues that are detected. This allows developers to identify and fix problems early in the development process, rather than waiting until later stages when they may be more difficult and costly to fix.
- CI is a key practice in agile software development and is widely used by developers to improve the quality and speed of software development.

- Some CI services are Travis CI or CircleCI
