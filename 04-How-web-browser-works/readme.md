# How web browser works
A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, view, and interact with websites and other online resources. Here's a more detailed overview of how a web browser works:

- The user opens the web browser on their device, such as a computer or mobile phone.

- The user types in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), such as "www.example.com" or "https://www.google.com" into the address bar, and hits enter.

- The web browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server where the website is hosted, asking for the webpage at that specific URL.

- The server receives the request and checks if it can fulfill it, if so, it retrieves the webpage from its database and sends it back to the browser as an HTTP response.

- The web browser receives the HTTP response, which contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the webpage, as well as any images, videos, and other media.

- The web browser then renders the webpage on the user's device, using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to display the text, images, and other elements of the webpage.

- The browser also interprets the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to apply formatting, layout and interactivity to the webpage.

- The browser also sends additional requests, for example, if the webpage contains links to other resources, such as images or videos, the browser sends additional requests for these resources.

- The browser allows the user to interact with the webpage through various controls such as buttons, links, and forms, which the browser sends requests to the server when user interacts.

This is a general overview of how a web browser works, it is a complex process that involves multiple technologies and protocols, but the main idea is that web browser sends a request to the server, the server responds with the resources to display the webpage, the browser then renders and displays the webpage, and allows the user to interact with it.
