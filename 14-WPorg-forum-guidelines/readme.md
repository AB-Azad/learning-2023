### Do Not Offer to Pay for Help
Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.

### Do Not Offer to Work For Hire
Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, as in beer.

### Do Not Post About Commercial Products



### Summary
- Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to approve a user’s posts. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and will be lifted when the moderators feel the situation has been resolved
- If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme, please direct them towards your own support resources.
