https://wordpress.org/support/guidelines/

### Do Not Offer to Pay for Help
Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.

### Do Not Offer to Work For Hire
Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, as in beer.

### Do Not Post About Commercial Products
For support of commercial themes or plugins, go to the official support channel.

Forum volunteers are also not given access to commercial products, so they would not know why a commercial theme or plugin is not working properly.

Ultimately, the vendors are responsible for supporting their commercial product.

If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme, please direct them towards your own support resources.

### Do Not Create Multiple Accounts (Sockpuppets)
Do not create multiple accounts, aka sockpuppets. Sockpuppetry is often used for nefarious reasons, and as such we ask that you simply don’t do it. If a sockpuppet account is identified, it will be banned immediately.

***If you are plugin or theme developer only,*** having separate personal and “business” accounts is acceptable for uploading code to the WordPress repo or for a very limited capacity of support of that plugin or theme. In that limited capacity that may not be consider to be sockpuppetry.

### When creating links to other resources
Public links in plugin or theme support topics may only be posted if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

- The link is to the plugin or theme authors own website.
- The link is to the plugin or theme authors own support website.
- The link is posted by the plugin or theme author them selves to an external resource related to the topic.
- The link is to resources on the WordPress.org website.
- The link is to a reputable image-sharing service for screenshots.

### The Bad Stuff…
- Do not post email addresses, ask others to post their email or solicit contacting people off of the forums.
- Do not post, offer, or ask for login information, even test IDs and test passwords.
- Do not post simply to request feedback on your site.
- Do not post another person’s private information (job, gender, living situation, location, etc).
- Do not ask for any kind of access in order to provide support, not even for plugins or themes.
- Do not contact people outside of WordPress.org for support or to respond to a post/review. This includes using contact forms on their websites, phone numbers, social media, or any other contact method.
- Do not recommend specific webhosts, nor post links to webhost recommendation sites.
- Do not post in all caps.

### Faq
***Why was my post closed?***
All posts (including reviews) are automatically closed after a certain period of inactivity (currently 6 months). They cannot be reopened after that time, not even by admins.

***How do I report harassment?***
You can either report the post (from the sidebar) or you can come to Slack and ask for help in the #forums channel. If you’re worried about making a request in public, just come to Slack and ask to speak to a moderator about harassment. We’re here for you.

Harassment by anyone is grounds for immediate banishment from WordPress.org. The following situations are examples of harassment:

- making multiple posts/replies to attack a person/company
- making multiple accounts to leave angry reviews/posts regarding a person/company
- following someone to twitter to complain at them
- using a contact form on someone’s site to continue contacting them
- We do not tolerate harassment of anyone, for any reason.

***Someone posted lies about me/my plugin/theme. Will you delete/edit the post?***
It depends on the situation.

There’s a difference between lying and just being wrong about facts. A lie is when someone intentionally says things they know aren’t true. Being wrong just means they’re mistaken, and that can be solved.

If someone’s just wrong about debugging a problem and blamed your plugin, that’s not a lie. Reply to the post and explain how they’re incorrect (nicely!) and try to help them out. It’s also not libel nor slander (the latter of which refers to spoken words) to post a review that they had a bad experience with your plugin or theme. That’s just someone’s experience, and they believe it to be true.

It’s all about intent. You can’t be sure of someone else’s, so we urge you to assume good faith.

That said, if someone’s harassing you (or your company) on the forums, do report the post or come by Slack to ask for help. We do not tolerate harassment from anyone, users nor developers

***What if someone’s causing trouble outside the forums?***
We do not have any authority over what people do to each other outside of WordPress.org, however abuse and harassment are not welcome in our community and may result in the abuser being banned.

If someone is harassing, bullying, or otherwise abusing people outside of WordPress.org, regarding a matter related to any of WordPress.org’s services, please let the moderators know in Slack. We will do our best to curtail this behavior immediately.

If the matter is regarding a specific plugin or theme, you can contact those teams directly at themes@wordpress.org or plugins@wordpress.org and those team will take appropriate action. This includes harassment from or towards developers. Everyone should be kind to each other


### Summary
- Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to approve a user’s posts. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and will be lifted when the moderators feel the situation has been resolved
- If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme, please direct them towards your own support resources.
